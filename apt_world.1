.TH apt-world 1 "April 22, 2025" "0.1" "apt-world Manual"
.SH NAME
apt-world \- List manually installed Debian packages
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B apt-world
[\fB-v\fR | \fB--verbose\fR]
[\fB--status-file\fR \fIPATH\fR]
[\fB--extended-states-file\fR \fIPATH\fR]
[\fB-h\fR | \fB--help\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B apt-world
parses the dpkg status file (default: /var/lib/dpkg/status)
and the apt extended states file (default: /var/lib/apt/extended_states)
to determine which currently installed packages were likely installed manually
by a user, rather than automatically as dependencies.
.PP
A package is considered manually installed if it is currently installed AND
it meets either of the following conditions:
.IP \(bu 2
It is explicitly marked with "Auto-Installed: 0" in the extended_states file.
.IP \(bu 2
It is NOT listed in the extended_states file at all (implicit manual).
.PP
Packages marked "Auto-Installed: 1" are considered automatic dependencies.
This utility provides output similar to the 'selected' set in Gentoo Portage.
It differs slightly from 'apt-mark showmanual' in that packages not
present in extended_states are included in the output. The output list
is sorted alphabetically and printed to standard output, one package per line.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB-v\fR, \fB--verbose\fR
Enable verbose (DEBUG level) logging to stderr. Shows internal steps like file paths being read and counts of packages found.
.TP
\fB--status-file\fR \fIPATH\fR
Specify an alternative path to the dpkg status file to parse.
Default: /var/lib/dpkg/status
.TP
\fB--extended-states-file\fR \fIPATH\fR
Specify an alternative path to the apt extended_states file to parse.
Default: /var/lib/apt/extended_states
.TP
\fB-h\fR, \fB--help\fR
Show a help message summarizing options and exit.
.SH FILES
.TP
\fI/var/lib/dpkg/status\fR
The dpkg status file containing information about installed packages. Read by default. Required for operation.

\fI/var/lib/apt/extended_states\fR
The apt extended states file containing the Auto-Installed flag. Read by default if available. If missing or unreadable, a warning is issued, and all installed packages are considered manual.
