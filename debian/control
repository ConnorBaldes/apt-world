Description: List manually installed Debian packages
 apt-world parses dpkg and apt status files to determine which packages
 were likely installed directly by the user, rather than automatically
 as dependencies.
 .
 It reads /var/lib/dpkg/status and /var/lib/apt/extended_states and
 considers a package manual if it's installed but not marked as
 Auto-Installed: 1 in the extended states file. This provides output
 similar to the 'selected' set in Gentoo Portage or 'apt-mark showmanual'.
