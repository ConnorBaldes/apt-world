.TH apt-world 1 "April 24, 2025" "0.1" "apt-world Manual"
.SH NAME
apt-world \- List manually installed Debian packages
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B apt-world
[\fB--explicitly-manual\fR | \fB--filter-base\fR]
[\fB-v\fR | \fB--verbose\fR]
[\fB--status-file\fR \fIPATH\fR]
[\fB--extended-states-file\fR \fIPATH\fR]
[\fB-h\fR | \fB--help\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B apt-world
parses the dpkg status file (default: /var/lib/dpkg/status)
and the apt extended states file (default: /var/lib/apt/extended_states)
to determine which currently installed packages were likely installed manually
by a user, rather than automatically as dependencies.
.PP
The script supports three modes of operation (see OPTIONS below):
.IP \(bu 2
Default Mode: Lists packages not marked `Auto-Installed: 1`.
.IP \(bu 2
Explicitly Manual Mode (`--explicitly-manual`): Lists only packages marked `Auto-Installed: 0`.
.IP \(bu 2
Filter Base Mode (`--filter-base`): Like Default Mode, but heuristically removes likely base system packages unless they are explicitly marked manual.
.PP
In Default Mode, a package is considered manually installed if it is currently installed AND
it meets either of the following conditions:
.IP \(bu 2
It is explicitly marked with "Auto-Installed: 0" in the extended_states file.
.IP \(bu 2
It is NOT listed in the extended_states file at all (implicit manual).
.PP
Packages marked "Auto-Installed: 1" are considered automatic dependencies.
This utility provides output similar to the 'selected' set in Gentoo Portage.
.PP
The output is presented as a formatted table to standard output, showing details for each listed package including Package Name, Architecture, Version, Auto Status (Explicit/Implicit), Priority, and Section. The list within the table is sorted alphabetically by package name.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB--explicitly-manual\fR
Mode 2: List only installed packages explicitly marked 'Auto-Installed: 0' in the extended_states file. This mode aims to show packages the user or an administrator has specifically flagged as manually installed via APT tools. Cannot be used with \fB--filter-base\fR.
.TP
\fB--filter-base\fR
Mode 3: Start with the Default Mode list, but then heuristically filter out packages that are likely part of the essential base system (Essential: yes or Priority: required/important) UNLESS those packages are also explicitly marked 'Auto-Installed: 0'. This attempts to provide a view closer to user-selected applications and libraries, excluding common system infrastructure. Cannot be used with \fB--explicitly-manual\fR.
.TP
\fB-v\fR, \fB--verbose\fR
Enable verbose (DEBUG level) logging to stderr. Shows internal steps like file paths being read and counts of packages found. Uses enhanced formatting via the 'rich' library.
.TP
\fB--status-file\fR \fIPATH\fR
Specify an alternative path to the dpkg status file to parse.
Default: /var/lib/dpkg/status
.TP
\fB--extended-states-file\fR \fIPATH\fR
Specify an alternative path to the apt extended_states file to parse.
Default: /var/lib/apt/extended_states
.TP
\fB-h\fR, \fB--help\fR
Show a help message summarizing options and exit.
.SH FILES
.TP
\fI/var/lib/dpkg/status\fR
The dpkg status file containing information about installed packages. Read by default. Required for operation.
.TP
\fI/var/lib/apt/extended_states\fR
The apt extended states file containing the Auto-Installed flag. Read by default if available. If missing or unreadable, a warning is issued, and Default and Filter Base modes consider all installed packages non-automatic (Explicit mode would find none unless explicitly marked 0).
