# Override explanation for bad-distribution-in-changes-file
# This error occurs during sbuild's internal lintian run because sbuild
# generates a temporary .changes file using the chroot distribution
# (e.g., bookworm) instead of the target distribution (e.g., unstable)
# from debian/changelog. This is an artifact of the sbuild check and
# not an error in the final package intended for upload.
